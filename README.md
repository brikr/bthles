# url-shortener
(Very) basic URL shortener using [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com).
This is mainly just a little pet project to familiarize myself with Sinatra; there are quite a few improvements that could be made, including:

- Follow [ruby-style-guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) a bit closer (e.g. no global variables)
- Making a prettier HTML page for submitting URLs
- Using a database instead of serialized list (e.g. `sqlite3`)
- Better URL verification/cleanup (e.g. allowing URLs without `http`/`https`, etc.)

And more..
